        <h2 className="-mb-5">Content policy</h2>
        <p>
          At Yiffer.xyz we strive to only host content which is publicly available, and we
          will remove any content from artists who ask us to do so. As the primary site
          for furry comics, we believe that artists gain significant amounts of followers
          through our website, as we display links to any profile we can find in the
          artist page. We have a soft quality requirement, meaning that not just any comic
          will be accepted. Censored comics, comics in foreign languages, or poorly drawn
          comics will all be rejected. Underage content is not allowed.
        </p>

        <h2 className="-mb-5">Technology</h2>
        <p>
          The current tech stack is quite an exciting one. We're running fully on the edge
          via Cloudflare. Front and back-ends are written in combination in Remix.js,
          hosted on Cloudflare Pages. This means all page loads are server-side rendered
          at blazing speeds. Our database is Cloudflare D1 SQL, an edge database. File
          storage is Cloudflare R2. Naturally, all of this is served via Cloudflare's CDN.
          This tech stack is a dream to work with!
        </p>
        <p className="-mt-2">
          In addition to the main parts described above, we have a small permanent server
          where image processing happens when things are uploaded, as that's harder to do
          on the edge. This is a simple Express/NodeJS server.
        </p>

        <h2 className="-mb-5">History</h2>
        <p>Yiffer.xyz has had three versions.</p>

        <h4 className="-mb-5">First version: 2016-2020</h4>
        <p>
          The first version was a simple site build with Angular.js (v1.6), with api
          (Express/NodeJS), database (MySQL) and file storage all hosted on a single VM,
          without containers or redundancy. Not very reliable, these decisions were result
          of the site being a side project where the developer was "learning by doing",
          not having any prior web dev experience.
        </p>

            { source: v1Artist, description: 'Artist page' },
            { source: v1Login, description: 'Login pop-up' },
            { source: v1Rate, description: 'Rating a comic' },
            { source: v1Suggest, description: 'Very simple comic suggestion form' },
          ]}
        />

        <h4 className="-mb-5">Second version: 2020-2025</h4>
        <p>
          The second version was a complete rewrite, and included more features. Our
          advertising system was introduced here, and the mod panel was massively
          extended. This version also included a change in visual profile, going from
          gray-and-pink to something very close to today's version, with green and blue
          hues.
        </p>
        <p>
          This front-end was built with Vue.js (Vue 2), with the api still Express/NodeJS
          and database still MySQL, but now hosted on Google Cloud. File storage was moved
          to Google Cloud too. Moreover, the site was containerized via Docker, and the
          front-end was split into three parts each hosted as their own web app via
          subdomains: The main site, the advertising part, and the mod panel.

                The expandable box design was not very practical when jumping between
                different tasks. Many things you'd typically do together were in entirely
                separate boxes. Half of the mod panel was not mobile-friendly, and even in
                desktop mode the horizontal scrolling was annoying. Usable, but far from
                ideal.

          )}
        </div>

        <h4 className="-mb-5">Third version: 2025-present</h4>
        <p>
          The third version is once again a complete rewrite, with the tech stack
          described above. New in v3 is the whole contributions system; previously, the
          only option for contributing by users was to suggest comics via name+links, and
          to suggest tag changes to comics - only a tiny part of how users can contribute
          today. A new minimal landing page was introduced to make helpful links easier to
          spot, instead of going directly to the comic browse page of previous versions.
          V3 also introduced a new rating system, going from ratings of 1-10, to 1-3
          stars. The reasoning behind this is that most people either rated things 8, 9,
          10, or 1. Bookmarking comics was also introduced in v3. Once again the mod panel
          was upgraded, from usable to delightful and <i>powerful</i>. About two thirds of
          development time has gone into the mod panel, because in the end, mods are the
          backbone of this site.
        </p>
        <p>
          The reason for this rewrite was to make further development as enjoyable and
          rapid as possible with brand new scalable technology. It also to cuts costs, as
          Google Cloud Platform (and all competitors such as AWS and Azure) is expensive.
