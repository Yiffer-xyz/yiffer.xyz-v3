          If you are an artist and want your content taken down, we will comply with your
          wishes. Contact us via contact@yiffer.xyz and provide proof of ownership and
          we'll get back to you quickly.

          In the future, we plan to let artists take control of their own comics if they
          wish to, and publish updates themselves. Are you an artist who's interested in
          this feature? Let us know! This is on our roadmap already, but if people show
          interest, we might get to it quicker than intially planned.
