        If you would like to follow your suggestion’s status, create an account! You can
        then follow updates in the “view your contributions” section above. Having a user
        will also earn you points in the scoreboard on the previous page. The more

      <h2 className="mt-6">Before you begin: requirements</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The comic must be at least four pages long.</li>
        <li>
          The comic must be a <i>comic</i>, not a collage (group of pictures with no
          story).
        </li>
        <li>The comic cannot have censoring bars.</li>
        <li>Colored comics are preferred. If not, it must be of good quality.</li>
        <li>In general, low quality (“poorly drawn”) comics will not be accepted.</li>
        <li>No cub comics.</li>
        <li>Pages must be in jpg og png format.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 className="mt-6">Checklist</h2>
      <p>
        <u>All</u> uploaded pages uploaded must be publicly available. A comic with some
        of its pages exclusive to subscription services (eg. Patreon, Subscribestar) will
        be rejected.
      </p>
      <Checkbox
        label="I confirm that the pages are publicly available"
        checked={hasCheckedPublic}
        onChange={v => setHasCheckedPublic(v)}
        className="mt-2"
      />

      <p className="mt-4">
        The pages uploaded must be of the highest possible resolution that is publicly
        available. Resized and compressed pages, often found on third-party websites, we
        not be accepted. Please check the artist's public galleries (like FurAffinity) to
        ensure that the page resolution is correct.
      </p>
      <Checkbox
        label="I confirm that the pages are in the highest resolution publicly available"
        checked={hasCheckedResolution}
        onChange={v => setHasCheckedResolution(v)}
        className="mt-2"
      />

      <h2 className="mt-6">Source</h2>
      {isMod && (
        <InfoBox
          variant="info"
          text={`As a mod, prviding the source is optional. It doesn't hurt to supply the link regardless, though!`}
          boldText={false}
          fitWidth
          className="mb-4"
        />
      )}

      <p>
        Where did you find the comic's pages? Please provide a link to and/or description
        of the source. If the pages are on individual links, a link to one page is enough
        - we don't need one for every page.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        If your answer is "google", or "on my computer", we will reject your upload, as it
        is harder for us to verify the page quality and availability (the "Checklist"
        checkboxes above).
      </p>

        value={source}
